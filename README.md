# 🚀 **MDC - Markdown Cleaner** 🧹

Tired of AI chunks looking like a wild jungle of `#headers`, `**bold text**`, `*italics*`, `[links](#)`, and bullet lists?

Say no more! **MDC** swoops in like a digital broom and sweeps all that fancy formatting away, leaving you with clean, plain text goodness.  

Perfect for when you just want the words without the noise!
